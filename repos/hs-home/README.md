set the following line in .bashrc (before I did this when running vim from command line I would see two powerlines when exiting insert mode)
export TERM=xterm-256color

You will probabaly need to install the meslo_lg_m_regular_for_powerline.otf font file
This file comes from here: 
https://github.com/powerline/fonts
https://github.com/powerline/fonts/tree/master/Meslo

- Just double click the meslo_lg_m_regular_for_powerline.otf font file and click the install button

Also you may need to set the set the system font
System->Preferences->Appearance->Fonts->Fixed Width Fonts

NOTE: I actually have this set to inconsolata and it seems to work fine, but if you have trouble switch to meslo
